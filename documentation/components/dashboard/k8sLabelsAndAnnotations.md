# Dashboard K8s Labels & Annotations

Dashboard has a reputation of using a lot of annotations and labels on various resources. This document should help serve to explain the use-cases behind each.

> Note: Not all resources shown in the Dashboard are K8s driven resources. For those that are not, this page does not have any impact on them.

> Note: This is not a comprehensive list of all labels & annotations used in OpenShift AI, just the ones managed and created by the Dashboard. Specific components may have ever-changing needs, so you should seek out those component's documentation for more information. 

* [Labels](#common-labels)
  * [`opendatahub.io/dashboard`](#opendatahubiodashboard)
* [Annotations](#common-annotations)
  * [`openshift.io/display-name`]
  * [`openshift.io/description`]
  * [`opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators`]
  * [`opendatahub.io/accelerator-name`]
  * [`opendatahub.io/sc-config`]
* [Specific Use-Cases](#specific-use-cases)

  * [Data Connections](#data-connections)
  * [ImageStreams](#imagestreams)
  * [Notebooks](#notebooks)
  * [ServingRuntime Templates](#servingruntime-templates)
  * [Storage Classes](#storage-classes)

## Common Labels

Common reused labels in the Dashboard. Key features of labels:

* Is able to be used as a filter in a k8s request
* Must be a restrictive k8s naming structure

### opendatahub.io/dashboard

The most common dashboard label. The initial goal here was to mark all things created by the Dashboard, so we could reverse lookup said resources. This has proven to be a bit over aggressive, adding friction in customers making use of external of the Dashboard flows work with Dashboard flows (eg. gitops).

This is a highly contentious label and will be seeing changes in the near future.

> Note: This concept is deprecated for DS Projects, it is adding no value and is adding confusion to the concept of ["what is a DS Project?"](./README.md#projects---openshift-console-vs-data-science-differences)

> Note: This concept is not entirely deprecated for some resources that have multiple uses, including those outside of OpenShift AI. But all OpenShift AI CRDs should not need this soon.

## Common Annotations

Common reused annotations in the Dashboard. Key features of annotations

* Can be a flexible field to be used for complex metadata or flexible usage of characters that are not K8s-safe (vs Labels)

### openshift.io/display-name

Used heavily by Dashboard UI flows to allow OpenShift AI users to craft a readable & flexible name. 

> Note: This is optional, so we fall back on the resource's k8s name. 

### openshift.io/description

Used almost as heavily as the display-name annotation. This allows for a description of the resource the user is creating. This usually is shown next to the display-name once the resource is created.

> Note: Some resources do not have the use for this, but that's more of an oversight than an intent.

> Note: This annotation is not required, nor tied to the use of the display-name annotation.

### opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators

> Type: string array of [AcceleratorProfile] k8s names.

This annotation is what we use to suggest a recommended connection between a resource's usage by the user & an accelerator profile created on the cluster. This appears as a tag next to the accelerator dropdown item in the UI.

### opendatahub.io/accelerator-name

> Type: a string value of the [AcceleratorProfile] k8s name.

This annotation is what we use to relate back to an accelerator profile. This is metadata to help with reselection of the right accelerator profile in read & edit modes. This is needed as a way to convert back from the resource values used to the proper profile the user selected. We have a fallback for legacy support for Nvidia GPU, but everything else will fail to locate a profile and show an intermediary custom profile that cannot be mutated in edit modes.

If no accelerator was selected, this value should not appear.

### opendatahub.io/sc-config

> Type: object
```js
{
    displayName: string;
    isEnabled: boolean;
    isDefault: boolean;
    lastModified: string;
    description?: string;
}
```

This annotation is used as internal Dashboard metadata to describe, enable, and set which storage class is the default. This annotation does not affect Openshift default storage classes.

## Specific Use-Cases

### Data Science Projects

* Labels
  * `modelmesh-enabled` - required by Model Mesh to say the project is using model mesh configurations
    > Note: When this is `true`, the project is Model Mesh. When this is `false`, we key off it to say this project is KServe
* Annotations
  * [`openshift.io/display-name`]
  * [`openshift.io/description`]

For the Project Sharing feature specifically:
* Label `opendatahub.io/project-sharing` is used to denote permissions crafted by Dashboard flows & thus show up in the Dashboard UI

### Data Connections

Specific additional items are used specifically in the usage of Data Connections.

* Labels
  * `opendatahub.io/managed` - helps us define that this is a managed resource by us and not a normal secret
* Annotations
  * [`openshift.io/display-name`]
  * `opendatahub.io/connection-type` - the type of connection, currently this is only S3

### ImageStreams

> Note: Out-of-the-box variants of ImageStreams is a Workbench backed feature.

These are configured by the admin in the UI and are provided as out-of-the-box examples.

* General Annotations
  * [`opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators`]
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-python-dependencies` - the python dependencies that are included in the image to list to the user
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-software` - the software that is included in the image to list to the user
* Annotations used primarily by the out-of-the-box images provided by the workbench component
  * (tag) `opendatahub.io/image-tag-outdated` - a `true` or `false` value to say if the image is present for lookup, but not intended for selection
  * (tag) `opendatahub.io/workbench-image-recommended` - the recommended tag to suggest to the user
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-image-order` - a weighed value to help with organization of the images in display lists for the user
* Annotations used primarily by the Admin UI when created custom Notebook Images
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-image-desc` - description provided by the user
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-image-name` - a display name provided by the user
  * `opendatahub.io/notebook-image-url` - the original image value from the user before it's processed for the ImageStream

### Notebooks

> Note: This is a Workbench backed feature.

* Labels
  * `opendatahub.io/odh-managed` - (unknown, potential legacy without value)
  * `opendatahub.io/user` - a translated username; the Dashboard k8s-ifies the user's username so we can compare or look up by user in the future
* Annotations
  * [`openshift.io/display-name`]
  * [`openshift.io/description`]
  * `opendatahub.io/username` - the actual username (related to the Label `opendatahub.io/user`)
  * [`opendatahub.io/accelerator-name`]

### ServingRuntime Templates

> Note: This is a Serving backed feature.

These are configured by the admin in the UI and are provided as out-of-the-box examples. These are stored as OpenShift Templates under the hood, but the admin only ever sees a ServingRuntime when configuring.

* Annotations (when configuring in the admin page)
  * [`openshift.io/display-name`]
  * `opendatahub.io/modelServingSupport` - (managed by the UI) an JSON Array of supported platforms; options: 'single', 'multi'
  * `opendatahub.io/apiProtocol` - (managed by the UI) the api protocols available; options (one of): 'REST', 'gRPC' 
  * `opendatahub.io/disable-gpu` - (optional, typed in) if the ServingRuntime should not be used with GPUs (aka accelerators)
  * [`opendatahub.io/recommended-accelerators`] - (optional, typed in)

* Annotations (when deploying in projects)
  * [`opendatahub.io/accelerator-name`]
  * `opendatahub.io/template-name` - the runtime used
  * `opendatahub.io/template-display-name` - the display name shown for the runtime

### Storage Classes

* Annotations
  * [`opendatahub.io/sc-config`] - (managed by the UI) a JSON Blob of storage class metadata
